# [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

    running a cluster storage daemon on every node
    running a logs collection daemon on every node
    running a node monitoring daemon on every node
